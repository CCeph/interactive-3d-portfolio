# 3D Portfolio

Many websites nowadays look roughly the same, which is very good for accessibility and familiarity. However, I wonder if there are unknown designs that might still mostly meet accessibility requirements while offering a refreshing take on a website.

This website couples as my portfolio and my attempt at a new style of navigation bar. Instead of either a bar appended to the top or side of the screen, or one that expands once clicked on, I made my navigation bar into a 3D objects that can be moved around.

## Shortcomings of Design

1. Mobile support is not great. It can be quite laggy, and some taps or drags register in unintended ways.
2. I have not coded keyboard support yet.
3. I have not coded screen reader support yet.
4. To prevent undesired clicks on faces when moving the cube, I had to use double click as the event to access one of the cube's faces. Double click is a rare and unfamiliar input method on websites.

## To-Do List

1. Prevent reloading the page on mobile when dragging the cube.
2. Figure out why the cube does not work on iOS and chromeOS.

## Compatibility

The website was tested on Chrome on PC. It is functional on Android, but there may be some bugs. It is not working on iOS or chromeOS.
